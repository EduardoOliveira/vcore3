  # Rat Rig V-core 3 Klipper Config
# Documentation: https://os.ratrig.com

# The first thing you'll need to do is go through this file and comment out / uncomment 
# the files and/or settings you need.
# You'll be able to print just fine with this config as it is, but it is recommended
# that you follow these steps to properly calibrate your printer:
# 0) Sanity check and PID Tuning: https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_checks.html
# 1) Pressure Advance: https://www.klipper3d.org/Pressure_Advance.html
# 2) Skew Correction: https://www.klipper3d.org/skew_correction.html
# 3) Resonance Compensation: https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html

### MACRO CONFIGURATION
[gcode_macro RatOS]
# Use absolute extrusion mode
# Set to True to use relative extrusion mode
variable_relative_extrusion: False
# Wait for extruder to reach 150 so an inductive probe (if present) is at a predictable temp. 
# Also allows the bed heat to spread a little, and softens any plastic that might be stuck to the nozzle.
# Set to False to disable
variable_preheat_extruder: True
# Calibrate the bed mesh in the START_PRINT macro.
# Set to false to skip BED_MESH_CALIBRATE, it will still load the BED_MESH 
# with the name "ratos", be sure to save your bed_mesh profile with that name.
# or override the _START_PRINT_BED_MESH macro to implement your own mesh handling logic.
variable_calibrate_bed_mesh: True
# Print a prime line at the end of the START_PRINT macro
# set to False to disable nozzle_priming.
variable_nozzle_priming: "primeline"
# Park in the back when waiting for the extruder to heat up
# set to "front" to park in the front, or "center" to park in the center.
variable_start_print_park_in: "back"
# Height to park it when waiting for extruder to heat.
variable_start_print_park_z_height: 25
# Skew profile to load before starting the print 
# uncomment this to use your calibrated skew correction profile.
#variable_skew_profile: "my_skew_profile"
# Park in the back after the print has ended or was cancelled.
# set to "front" to park in the front, or "center" to park in the center.
variable_end_print_park_in: "back"
# Park in the back when the print is paused.
# set to "front" to park in the front, or "center" to park in the center.
variable_pause_print_park_in: "back"
# Set the speed for travel moves in RatOS Macros in mm/s.
